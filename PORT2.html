    <h2>Introduction to Data and Information</h2>
    <h3>Definitions and Differences:</h3>
    <p><strong>Data:</strong> Refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures without context. It could be numbers, characters, or symbols, which on their own, don't carry much meaning. It is often described as meaningless without additional processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Information:</strong> Refers to processed data that is structured and organized to provide meaning. Context gives data meaning, making it useful for decision-making and analysis.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Data vs. Information:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> "150, 200, 175" – <strong>Information:</strong> "Monthly sales in thousands of dollars for Q1."</li>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> "A, B, C, D" – <strong>Information:</strong> "Grades of students in a class."</li>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> "20°C, 22°C, 25°C" – <strong>Information:</strong> "Daily average temperatures for a week."</li>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> "100101" – <strong>Information:</strong> "Binary code representing a character in ASCII."</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Introduction to Information Systems</h2>
    <h3>Definition and Components:</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Information Systems (IS) refer to a structured system designed to gather, store, manage, and distribute data to support decision-making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization in organizations.</p>
    <p><strong>Components:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task:</strong> The specific functions the system is designed to support.</li>
        <li><strong>People:</strong> The users interacting with the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Structure (Roles):</strong> The organizational roles involved in the system's use.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology:</strong> The hardware and software that enable the system to function.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Importance in Modern Organizations:</h3>
    <p>Information Systems are essential for managing operations, enabling informed decisions, and enhancing efficiency. For example, Amazon uses IS for inventory management and customer service, contributing to its success.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Amazon uses IS for inventory management and customer service, contributing to its success.</li>
        <li>Corporations process financial data, manage human resources, and engage customers through online platforms like eBay or Amazon.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Types of Support Systems in Information Systems</h2>
    <h3>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS):</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> TPS is an operational-level system that manages day-to-day transactions. It handles the collection and storage of transaction data.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Payroll systems that process employee payments.</p>
<br>

    <h3>Management Information Systems (MIS):</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> MIS helps middle managers with internal data processing and reporting to ensure the smooth running of the organization.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sales management systems tracking performance metrics.</p>
<br>

    <h3>Decision Support Systems (DSS):</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> DSS aids senior managers with decision-making by analyzing complex data and presenting various scenarios.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Financial planning systems for "what-if" analysis.</p>
<br>

    <h3>Executive Information Systems (EIS):</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> EIS supports top executives by providing an overview of the organization's performance and external environment through dashboards.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Customized dashboards showing key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>
<br>

    <h2>Synthesis: The Strategic Importance of Information Systems</h2>
    <p>Information Systems enable organizations to operate more efficiently, make well-informed decisions, and stay competitive. With the integration of AI and machine learning, IS will continue to evolve and provide more sophisticated decision support systems for the future.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Analysis and Reflection</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Understanding the distinction between data and information is crucial in today's digital world. Data refers to raw facts, figures, or symbols without context, like a list of random numbers. On their own, they hold little meaning. For example, “150, 200, 175” is just a series of numbers, and without any explanation, they don’t provide much value. However, when we know they represent "monthly sales in thousands of dollars," this becomes information—structured and contextual data that can support decision-making.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is where Information Systems (IS) come in. By organizing and processing data to facilitate better decision-making, IS assists organizations in transforming raw data into insightful understandings. Companies rely on these platforms to run operations effectively, from e-commerce platforms like Amazon to global auction sites like eBay. For instance, Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) are the foundation of Amazon's payroll and inventory systems. TPS manages routine operations by gathering and archiving transaction data. TPS serves as the foundation of operations and is crucial to the flawless operation of businesses.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond daily operations, structured reports created using past and current information are provided by Management Information Systems (MIS), which assist middle managers in making better decisions. As one moves up the hierarchy, Decision Support Systems (DSS) provide senior managers with tools to model various situations, assisting them in making difficult decisions and making long-term plans. Lastly, to develop a long-term strategy, top executives can examine both internal data and external market trends using Executive Information Systems (EIS).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Businesses are becoming more strategic and efficient as IS continues to evolve in accordance with advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But along with these improvements come new difficulties, such as cybersecurity and data privacy. To fully utilize information technologies in the future, it will be crucial to strike a balance between security and innovation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To put it briefly, the ability of IS to effectively transform data into information is essential for modern organizations. It keeps companies competitive in a market that is changing quickly and gives them the ability to make smart, well-informed decisions.</p>
